--- Elastic Rope --- 

There is an obstacle on a 2D plane in the form of a simple polygon with vertices at point.
Vertex  connects with vertex  via a rope. Each point on the rope is outside the polygon,
but the points can be on the boundary. The rope is elastic, meaning it always tries to minimize its length
and the friction force between the obstacle and the rope is zero. The ends of the rope are fixed at points
and  and no other point on the rope is fixed.

If the shape of the rope is a line that has never intersects with or overlaps itself,
what's the maximum possible length of the rope?

--- Convex Hull ---

Given a 2-D set of random points find calculate the convex hull using the Graham Scan Algorithm

--- Circle City ---

Roy lives in a city that is circular in shape on a  plane that has radius R.
The city center is located at origin and it has suburbs lying on the lattice points (points with integer coordinates).
The city Police Department Headquarters can only protect those suburbs which are located strictly inside the city.
The suburbs located on the border of the city are still unprotected. So the police department decides to build at most
additional police stations at some suburbs. Each of these police stations can protect the suburb it is located in.

Given the square of radius, , of the city, Roy has to determine if it is possible to protect all the suburbs.

--- isLeft --- 

Given 3 points A,B and C determine if C is on the left side of the line AB (Used in Elastic Rope and Graham Scan)

--- Jim Beam --- 

Jim likes to play with laser beams. 
Jim stays at point (0,0). 
There is a mirror at point (Xm,Ym) and a wall between points (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2).

Jim wants to find out if he can point the laser beam on the mirror.

--- PolarAngles --- 

A point (x,y), on the cartesian plane, makes an angle theta with the positive direction of the x-axis. Theta varies in the interval [0 ,2PI) radians, i.e, greater than or equal to zero; but less than 2*PI radians.
